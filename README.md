# Traffic_flow_prediction
Urban transportation systems face challenges such as congestion, environmental
impacts, and the need for efficient travel. Traffic flow prediction helps alleviate these
issues by providing data-driven insights into expected traffic patterns, allowing city
planners to make informed decisions. By accurately predicting traffic flow across a
network of sensors, cities can improve road safety, reduce travel times, and mitigate
congestion. This project employs Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks
(STGCN) to predict traffic flow patterns on a city-wide scale, leveraging both spatial and
temporal dependencies inherent in traffic data.
